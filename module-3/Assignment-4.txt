Transfer Learning with PyTorch

Objective: To gain hands-on experience in performing transfer learning using PyTorch and pretrained models for image classification tasks.

Task:

In this assignment, students will explore transfer learning with PyTorch by taking advantage of pretrained models such as ResNet or Inception. They will adapt a pretrained model for a specific image classification task, fine-tune it, and evaluate its performance using a custom dataset. This assignment will help students understand the power of transfer learning and how pretrained models can be leveraged for their own projects.

Instructions:

1. Introduction to Transfer Learning:

Begin with an introduction to the concept of transfer learning in deep learning. Explain how pretrained models can be used as a starting point for custom tasks, saving time and computational resources.
2. Problem Statement:

Define an image classification problem for students to work on. For example, they can classify images of animals into different species or identify plant diseases from images.
3. Pretrained Model Selection:

Guide students in selecting an appropriate pretrained model (e.g., ResNet, Inception) based on their chosen image classification problem. Explain why the selected model is a good fit.
4. Custom Dataset Preparation:

Instruct students to collect or provide them with a custom dataset relevant to the chosen problem. They should preprocess the dataset, including data augmentation and splitting it into training and testing sets.
5. Model Adaptation:

Teach students how to adapt the pretrained model for their specific classification task. They should replace the model's final classification layer with a new layer that matches the number of classes in their dataset.
6. Fine-Tuning:

Explain the concept of fine-tuning, where students only update the weights of the adapted layers while keeping the pretrained layers fixed. Guide them through the process of fine-tuning the model on their custom dataset.
7. Training Loop:

Help students set up a training loop using PyTorch. They should train the model, calculate loss, and monitor performance metrics during training.
8. Evaluation:

Instruct students to evaluate the fine-tuned model's performance on the test dataset. They should report classification accuracy and potentially other relevant metrics based on their problem.
9. Visualization:

Encourage students to create visualizations, such as confusion matrices or sample predictions, to illustrate the model's performance.
10. Experimentation:

Challenge students to experiment with different hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, batch size) and observe their impact on model performance.
11. Conclusion:
- Conclude the assignment by discussing the benefits and challenges of transfer learning, as well as insights gained from the experiments.

12. Reporting:
- Students should document their work in a report or Jupyter notebook, including code, visualizations, and explanations.

Evaluation Criteria:

This assignment will be assessed based on the following criteria:

Correct adaptation and fine-tuning of a pretrained model using PyTorch.
Proper dataset preparation, including data augmentation and splitting.
Successful training and evaluation of the fine-tuned model.
Quality of visualizations and ability to interpret results.
Creativity and thoroughness in experimentation.
Clarity and completeness of the report or notebook.
