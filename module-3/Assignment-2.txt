Image Classification with Pretrained Models

Objective: To gain experience in working with pretrained deep learning models for image classification tasks using TensorFlow and Keras.

Task:

In this assignment, students will learn how to leverage pretrained deep learning models to perform image classification. They will use TensorFlow and Keras to fine-tune a pretrained model (e.g., ResNet, VGG) for a specific image classification task, load the model, adapt it to their problem, and evaluate its performance.

Instructions:

1. Introduction:

Begin with an introduction to the concept of transfer learning and the benefits of using pretrained models for image classification.
2. Problem Statement:

Assign students a specific image classification task. For example, they could classify images of animals, plants, or everyday objects into different categories.
3. Dataset Selection and Preparation:

Instruct students to select an appropriate dataset for their image classification task. They should also preprocess the dataset, including resizing images and splitting it into training and testing sets.
4. Pretrained Model Selection:

Provide a list of pretrained deep learning models (e.g., ResNet, VGG, Inception) available in TensorFlow and Keras. Students should choose a model that suits their problem.
5. Model Fine-Tuning:

Guide students through the process of fine-tuning the selected pretrained model for their image classification task. This includes:
Loading the pretrained model.
Modifying the model's architecture (e.g., changing the number of output classes).
Compiling the model with appropriate loss and optimization settings.
Defining data augmentation techniques to enhance the training dataset.
6. Training:

Instruct students to train the fine-tuned model on the training dataset. They should monitor training metrics (e.g., loss, accuracy) and visualize the training history.
7. Evaluation:

Encourage students to evaluate the model's performance on the test dataset, including metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
8. Visualization:

Ask students to provide visualizations of the model's predictions, such as confusion matrices or sample images with predicted labels.
9. Experimentation:

Challenge students to experiment with different hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, batch size) or data augmentation techniques to observe their impact on model performance.
10. Conclusion:
- Conclude the assignment with a summary of their experience in fine-tuning pretrained models for image classification and insights gained from the experiments.

11. Reporting:
- Students should document their work in a report or Jupyter notebook, including code, visualizations, and explanations.

Evaluation Criteria:

This assignment will be assessed based on the following criteria:

Correct implementation of fine-tuning a pretrained model for image classification.
Proper dataset selection and preprocessing.
Training the model and monitoring training metrics.
Accurate evaluation of the model's performance using appropriate metrics.
Quality of visualizations and ability to interpret results.
Creativity and thoroughness in experimentation.
Clarity and completeness of the report or notebook.
