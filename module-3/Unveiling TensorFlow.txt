TensorFlow's Foundation: Building Blocks of a Deep Learning Framework
To grasp the significance of TensorFlow, it's essential to understand its fundamental building blocks:

1. Computational Graph:
At the heart of TensorFlow lies the concept of a computational graph. Think of it as a blueprint that outlines the operations and computations performed by the neural network. This graph forms the foundation for defining, training, and executing machine learning models.

2. Tensors:
In TensorFlow, data is represented as tensors—multidimensional arrays that hold numerical values. These tensors flow through the computational graph, undergoing transformations and computations as they traverse the network.

3. Operations:
TensorFlow provides a rich set of operations (ops) that define computations performed on tensors. These operations encompass mathematical operations, activation functions, loss functions, and more. The magic of TensorFlow lies in orchestrating these operations to create intricate neural network architectures.

Unraveling the Benefits: Why TensorFlow?
As a beginner, uncovering the benefits of TensorFlow is akin to discovering a treasure trove of tools that empower you to build, train, and deploy neural networks:
