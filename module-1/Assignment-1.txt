Machine Learning Terminology

Objective: To build a comprehensive glossary of key machine learning concepts and terminology.

Task:

In this assignment, students will delve into the fundamental concepts and terminology of machine learning. They will create a glossary that not only defines these terms but also provides clear explanations and practical examples to enhance their understanding.

Instructions:

Glossary Compilation:

Provide students with a list of key machine learning terms and concepts that they need to include in the glossary. These terms may include, but are not limited to:
Supervised Learning
Unsupervised Learning
Overfitting
Underfitting
Feature Engineering
Cross-Validation
Bias-Variance Tradeoff
Hyperparameters
Precision and Recall
ROC Curve
Gradient Descent
Neural Network
Ensemble Learning
Regularization
Explanation and Example:

For each term or concept, students should provide:
A clear explanation that describes what the term means in the context of machine learning.
A practical example or scenario that illustrates the concept. The example can be in the form of a simple problem or dataset where the concept is relevant.
Any relevant formulas or equations if applicable.
Structured Document:

Instruct students to organize the glossary as a structured document (e.g., a Word document or Google Doc) with each term and its explanation presented in a clear and concise manner.
They should use headings or sections to separate different terms.
Peer Review:

Encourage students to review and provide feedback on each other's glossaries to ensure accuracy and clarity.
Consider assigning each student a few terms to review and provide constructive feedback.
Presentation:

Depending on the class size, you can arrange a presentation session where each student briefly presents and explains one or more terms from their glossary to the class. This allows for further discussion and clarification.
Evaluation Criteria:

This assignment will be assessed based on the following criteria:

Clarity and accuracy of term explanations.
Relevance and quality of practical examples provided.
Organization and structure of the glossary document.
Contribution to peer review and feedback process (if applicable).
Overall presentation and communication skills (if presentations are part of the assignment).
