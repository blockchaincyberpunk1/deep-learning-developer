Neural Network Visualization

Objective: To gain an intuitive understanding of neural networks by visualizing their behavior and experimenting with custom architectures.

Task:

In this assignment, students will utilize a neural network visualization tool (e.g., TensorFlow Playground, Neural Network Playground) to interactively create and modify neural network architectures. By observing real-time visualizations, students will develop insights into how various network parameters and structures impact a model's behavior.

Instructions:

1. Introduction to Neural Network Visualization:

Start by introducing students to the importance of visualizing neural networks and understanding their inner workings.
Explain that neural network visualization tools provide a user-friendly way to experiment with different network architectures and parameters.
2. Select a Neural Network Visualization Tool:

Provide recommendations or options for neural network visualization tools that students can use for this assignment. Examples include TensorFlow Playground, Neural Network Playground, or similar online platforms.
3. Basic Exploration:

Instruct students to explore the chosen visualization tool by following these steps:
Launch the tool and become familiar with its interface.
Start with a basic neural network configuration (e.g., single layer, a few neurons) and observe its behavior when given sample data.
Encourage students to change parameters like the activation function, learning rate, and dataset characteristics.
4. Custom Neural Network Architectures:

Assign students to create custom neural network architectures and observe their behavior. Examples of experiments they can conduct include:
Experiment 1: A network with a single hidden layer and different activation functions (e.g., sigmoid, ReLU).
Experiment 2: A deep neural network with multiple hidden layers and varying numbers of neurons.
Experiment 3: A network with different learning rates to observe convergence speed.
Experiment 4: A convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture (if the tool supports CNN visualization).
Experiment 5 (Optional): A recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture (if supported).
5. Behavior Analysis:

In each experiment, students should:
Describe their custom neural network architecture and parameter settings.
Observe how changes in architecture and parameters affect the network's ability to learn and make predictions.
Record insights into the behavior of different configurations.
6. Report and Analysis:

Ask students to prepare a report summarizing their experiments and observations. The report should include:
An introduction outlining the assignment's objectives.
Descriptions of each experiment, including neural network architecture details and parameter settings.
Visualizations or screenshots of the neural network behavior during experiments.
An analysis of how different configurations impacted the network's learning process.
Insights into best practices and trade-offs observed.
7. Discussion (Optional):

If time allows, encourage students to discuss their findings with their peers or in a class discussion.
Evaluation Criteria:

This assignment will be assessed based on the following criteria:

The variety and complexity of experiments conducted.
Clarity and completeness of the report.
Insights into the behavior of different neural network configurations.
Effective use of the chosen neural network visualization tool.
Overall understanding of how neural network architecture and parameters influence model behavior.
