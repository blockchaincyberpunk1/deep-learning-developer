Reinforcement Learning Project

Objective: To work on a reinforcement learning project using deep reinforcement learning techniques.

Task:

In this assignment, students will embark on a reinforcement learning (RL) project using a deep reinforcement learning framework, such as OpenAI Gym. The objective is to gain practical experience in training an agent to perform a specific task within a chosen environment. Here are the detailed tasks:

1. Environment Selection:

Instruct students to select an environment from OpenAI Gym or another RL framework. They should choose an environment that aligns with their interests and project goals. Examples include classic control tasks, Atari games, or custom environments.
2. Problem Definition:

Have students clearly define the problem they intend to solve in the selected environment. This could involve tasks like game playing, control tasks, navigation, or any other RL-applicable problem.
3. Agent and Algorithm Selection:

Guide students in choosing a reinforcement learning algorithm suitable for the selected problem. Common options include:
Deep Q-Network (DQN).
Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C).
Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO).
Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO).
Students should select an agent architecture and RL algorithm that matches the complexity of the problem.
4. Environment Setup:

Instruct students to set up the chosen RL environment and ensure compatibility with their selected deep reinforcement learning framework. They should understand the environment's dynamics, states, actions, and rewards.
5. Agent Implementation:

Ask students to implement the RL agent using the selected algorithm and deep learning framework (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch).
They should design and train a neural network that serves as the agent's policy or value function.
6. Training and Experimentation:

Encourage students to experiment with different hyperparameters, network architectures, and training strategies to optimize their agent's performance.
They should run multiple training sessions and record key metrics and observations.
7. Performance Evaluation:

Require students to evaluate their trained agent's performance using appropriate evaluation metrics. For example, in game-playing tasks, they can report the average score achieved over multiple episodes.
8. Report and Presentation:

Ask students to create a comprehensive project report that includes problem formulation, agent architecture, training details, results, and insights gained.
Have them prepare a presentation summarizing their project and findings, which they can share with the class.
Evaluation Criteria:

This assignment will be assessed based on the following criteria:

Appropriate environment selection and problem definition.
Correct implementation of the RL agent and algorithm.
Successful training and experimentation, including fine-tuning.
Thorough performance evaluation with relevant metrics.
Quality of the project report and presentation, demonstrating clear understanding and insights.
