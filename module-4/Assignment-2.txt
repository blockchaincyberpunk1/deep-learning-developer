Object Detection with Faster R-CNN

Objective: To gain an understanding of object detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and specifically implement a Faster R-CNN model.

Task:

In this assignment, students will be tasked with implementing a Faster R-CNN (Region-based Convolutional Neural Network) model for object detection using a deep learning framework, such as PyTorch. They will work with a provided object detection dataset and train the model to detect and localize objects within images.

Instructions:

1. Introduction:

Provide an introduction to the importance and applications of object detection in computer vision, such as autonomous driving, surveillance, and robotics.
2. Dataset:

Describe the object detection dataset provided for the assignment, including the types of objects to be detected, the format of annotations (bounding boxes), and the number of classes.
3. Framework Selection:

Instruct students to choose a deep learning framework (e.g., PyTorch) for implementing the Faster R-CNN model. They should explain their choice briefly.
4. Model Architecture:

Guide students through the design of the Faster R-CNN model architecture, explaining the components like the backbone network (e.g., ResNet), Region Proposal Network (RPN), and the classification and regression heads.
5. Data Preprocessing:

Explain the necessary data preprocessing steps, including image resizing, data augmentation, and encoding bounding box annotations.
6. Model Training:

Provide instructions on how to train the Faster R-CNN model using the selected framework. Students should specify the number of epochs, batch size, and optimizer. Explain how to balance classification and regression losses.
7. Evaluation:

Instruct students to evaluate the trained model's performance using metrics such as mean Average Precision (mAP), precision, recall, and F1-score.
8. Hyperparameter Tuning:

Encourage students to experiment with hyperparameter tuning to improve model performance. They can adjust learning rates, anchor sizes, and other hyperparameters.
9. Visualization:

Guide students on how to visualize the model's predictions, including bounding boxes drawn on test images, and provide code examples for generating these visualizations.
10. Testing:
- Instruct students to use the trained model to make predictions on a test dataset, and calculate the final performance metrics.

11. Report:
- Students should compile their findings and results into a comprehensive report. The report should include model architecture diagrams, code snippets, training and evaluation results, visualizations, and a discussion of the model's performance.

Evaluation Criteria:

This assignment will be assessed based on the following criteria:

Implementation of a well-designed Faster R-CNN model.
Correct preprocessing of the object detection dataset.
Accurate training and evaluation of the model, including mAP and other relevant metrics.
Proper use of hyperparameter tuning techniques.
Quality and organization of the report, including visualizations.
The overall performance of the Faster R-CNN model in object detection and localization.
