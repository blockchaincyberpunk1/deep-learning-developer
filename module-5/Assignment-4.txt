Fine-Tuning for Object Detection

Objective: To gain practical experience in object detection using transfer learning by fine-tuning a pre-trained model for a custom object detection task.

Task:

In this assignment, students will apply transfer learning techniques to perform object detection. They will use a pre-trained deep learning model as a starting point and fine-tune it for a specific object detection task. This assignment provides hands-on experience in adapting models for real-world applications.

Instructions:

1. Introduction to Object Detection and Transfer Learning:

Begin by introducing the concepts of object detection and transfer learning. Explain the importance of using pre-trained models as a foundation for custom object detection tasks.
2. Dataset Description:

Describe the object detection dataset that students will use for this assignment. Provide information about the number of object classes, image dimensions, and any specific characteristics of the dataset.
3. Selection of Pre-trained Model:

Instruct students to choose a pre-trained deep learning model suitable for object detection tasks (e.g., Faster R-CNN, YOLO). They should explain their choice based on the complexity of the dataset and the model's architecture.
4. Data Preprocessing:

Explain the data preprocessing steps, including data loading, resizing, and annotation conversion (if applicable). Ensure students understand how to prepare the dataset for training and fine-tuning.
5. Model Fine-Tuning:

Describe the process of fine-tuning the chosen pre-trained model for the object detection task. Students should understand how to adapt the model's architecture for their specific dataset and problem.
6. Transfer Learning Layers:

Instruct students to identify and explain which layers of the pre-trained model they will freeze and which layers they will retrain during fine-tuning. Discuss the reasoning behind this decision.
7. Loss Function and Optimizer:

Guide students on choosing an appropriate loss function and optimizer for their object detection task. Discuss why specific choices are suitable for their problem.
8. Training the Model:

Explain the training process, including setting hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, batch size) and the number of epochs. Students should understand how to monitor the training process and visualize training metrics.
9. Evaluation Metrics:

Describe the evaluation metrics used for assessing the performance of the fine-tuned object detection model. Common metrics include mean Average Precision (mAP), precision, recall, and F1-score.
10. Model Evaluation:
- Instruct students to evaluate the fine-tuned model's performance on a validation dataset. They should calculate and report relevant evaluation metrics and compare the results to the pre-trained model's performance.

11. Testing and Detection:
- Encourage students to use the fine-tuned model to perform object detection on a test dataset or new images. They should report detection results, including bounding boxes and class labels.

12. Report and Analysis:
- Students should compile their findings and results into a comprehensive report. The report should include model architecture diagrams, code snippets, training and evaluation results, visualizations, and a discussion of the model's performance and potential improvements.

Evaluation Criteria:

This assignment will be assessed based on the following criteria:

Selection and adaptation of an appropriate pre-trained deep learning model for object detection.
Correct data preprocessing and loading, including annotation conversion.
Accurate fine-tuning of the model for the object detection task.
Quality and organization of the report, including visualizations and evaluation metrics.
The overall performance of the fine-tuned object detection model, including mAP, precision, recall, and any additional insights gained.
