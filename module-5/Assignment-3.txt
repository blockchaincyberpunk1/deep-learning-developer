Image Classification with Transfer Learning

Objective: To gain hands-on experience in transfer learning by using a pre-trained deep learning model for image classification and fine-tuning it for a specific task.

Task:

In this assignment, students will apply transfer learning techniques to build a highly accurate image classification model using a pre-trained deep learning model as a starting point. Transfer learning allows students to leverage the knowledge learned by a model on a large dataset for a different, smaller dataset, making it a valuable skill in various real-world applications.

Instructions:

1. Introduction to Transfer Learning:

Begin by introducing the concept of transfer learning in deep learning. Explain the significance of using pre-trained models and how they can be adapted for specific tasks.
2. Dataset Description:

Describe the image classification dataset that students will use for this assignment. Provide information about the number of classes, image dimensions, and any specific characteristics of the dataset.
3. Selection of Pre-trained Model:

Instruct students to choose a pre-trained deep learning model from a popular framework (e.g., VGG, ResNet, Inception) as their starting point. They should explain their choice based on the complexity of the dataset and the model's architecture.
4. Data Preprocessing:

Explain the data preprocessing steps, including data loading, resizing, and data augmentation (if applicable). Ensure students understand how to prepare the dataset for training and fine-tuning.
5. Model Fine-Tuning:

Describe the process of fine-tuning the chosen pre-trained model for the image classification task. Students should understand how to adapt the model's architecture for their specific dataset and problem.
6. Transfer Learning Layers:

Instruct students to identify and explain which layers of the pre-trained model they will freeze and which layers they will retrain during fine-tuning. Discuss the reasoning behind this decision.
7. Loss Function and Optimizer:

Guide students on choosing an appropriate loss function and optimizer for their image classification task. Discuss why specific choices are suitable for their problem.
8. Training the Model:

Explain the training process, including setting hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, batch size) and the number of epochs. Students should understand how to monitor the training process and visualize training metrics.
9. Evaluation Metrics:

Describe the evaluation metrics used for assessing the performance of the fine-tuned model. Common metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
10. Model Evaluation:
- Instruct students to evaluate the fine-tuned model's performance on a validation dataset. They should calculate and report relevant evaluation metrics and compare the results to the pre-trained model's performance.

11. Testing and Prediction:
- Encourage students to use the fine-tuned model to make predictions on a test dataset or new images. They should report the model's accuracy and any insights gained.

12. Report and Analysis:
- Students should compile their findings and results into a comprehensive report. The report should include model architecture diagrams, code snippets, training and evaluation results, visualizations, and a discussion of the model's performance and potential improvements.

Evaluation Criteria:

This assignment will be assessed based on the following criteria:

Selection and adaptation of an appropriate pre-trained deep learning model.
Correct data preprocessing and loading.
Accurate fine-tuning of the model for the image classification task.
Quality and organization of the report, including visualizations and evaluation metrics.
The overall performance of the fine-tuned model, including classification accuracy and any additional insights gained.
