Recommendation System

Objective: To build a recommendation system using deep learning techniques.

Task:

In this assignment, students will develop a recommendation system project using deep learning methods. They will work with a dataset containing user interactions, such as ratings, clicks, or purchases, to build a recommendation model that suggests items to users based on their preferences and behavior. The assignment tasks are as follows:

1. Dataset Selection:

Provide students with a dataset that includes user-item interactions. The dataset may include user IDs, item IDs, and interaction strength (e.g., ratings, click-through rates).
2. Data Preprocessing:

Instruct students to preprocess the dataset, including handling missing values, normalizing data, and encoding categorical features if necessary. They should also split the dataset into training and testing sets.
3. Model Selection:

Guide students in selecting an appropriate deep learning-based recommendation model. They can choose from various models, including:
Matrix factorization-based models (e.g., Singular Value Decomposition, Alternating Least Squares)
Neural collaborative filtering (NeuMF) models
Sequence-aware recommendation models (e.g., Recurrent Neural Networks, Transformers)
Autoencoders for collaborative filtering
Graph-based recommendation models (e.g., Graph Neural Networks)
4. Model Design:

Help students design the architecture of their chosen recommendation model. They should define the number of layers, activation functions, embedding dimensions, and any additional layers specific to the chosen model.
5. Model Training:

Instruct students to train the deep learning recommendation model using the training dataset. They should specify the loss function (e.g., mean squared error, binary cross-entropy), optimizer (e.g., Adam), and suitable evaluation metrics (e.g., RMSE, precision, recall) for recommendation systems.
6. Evaluation Metrics:

Explain the relevant evaluation metrics for recommendation systems. Students should calculate and report these metrics to assess their model's performance on the test dataset.
7. Model Evaluation:

Assign students the task of evaluating their trained recommendation system model. They should analyze and report the model's ability to make accurate item recommendations for users.
8. Fine-Tuning and Hyperparameter Optimization:

Encourage students to explore hyperparameter tuning techniques to improve the recommendation model's performance. They can use techniques like grid search or random search.
9. Recommendations Generation:

Instruct students to generate item recommendations for users in the test dataset. They should also provide a mechanism for making real-time recommendations.
10. Report and Presentation:
- Require students to create a comprehensive report that includes details about the dataset, model architecture, training process, evaluation metrics, recommendations generation, and conclusions. They should also prepare a presentation to showcase their findings.

Evaluation Criteria:

This assignment will be assessed based on the following criteria:

Effective preprocessing and handling of the recommendation dataset.
Correct implementation and training of the deep learning-based recommendation model.
Appropriate selection of evaluation metrics and thorough model evaluation.
Quality of item recommendations generated by the model.
Quality of the report and presentation, including code documentation and explanations.
Demonstrated understanding of building recommendation systems using deep learning techniques.
