Image Classification Project

Objective: To design and implement an image classification project using deep learning techniques.

Task:

In this assignment, students will work on building an image classification project using a deep learning framework (e.g., TensorFlow or PyTorch). They will perform the following tasks:

1. Dataset Selection:

Provide students with a dataset that includes a collection of images with labeled categories/classes. The dataset should have a sufficient number of images in each class.
2. Data Preprocessing:

Instruct students to perform data preprocessing, which may include resizing images, normalizing pixel values, and augmenting the dataset to improve model generalization. They should also split the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets.
3. Model Architecture:

Guide students in designing a neural network architecture for image classification. They should choose appropriate layers, activation functions, and the number of neurons. Encourage them to experiment with different architectures.
4. Model Training:

Instruct students to train the neural network on the training dataset using an appropriate loss function (e.g., categorical cross-entropy) and optimizer (e.g., Adam or SGD). They should set hyperparameters such as learning rate and batch size.
5. Model Evaluation:

Assign students the task of evaluating the trained model on the validation and testing datasets. They should calculate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices to assess the model's performance.
6. Hyperparameter Tuning:

Encourage students to explore hyperparameter tuning techniques to optimize the model's performance. They can experiment with different learning rates, batch sizes, and network architectures.
7. Error Analysis:

Students should analyze the model's predictions, identify common errors, and discuss potential reasons for misclassifications.
8. Model Deployment (Optional):

Optionally, students can deploy the trained model in a real-world application, such as a web service or mobile app, and demonstrate its classification capabilities.
9. Report and Presentation:

Require students to create a comprehensive report that includes details about the dataset, model architecture, training process, evaluation results, error analysis, and any deployment efforts. Additionally, they should prepare a presentation to communicate their findings and model performance.
Evaluation Criteria:

This assignment will be assessed based on the following criteria:

Proper data preprocessing techniques applied.
Correct implementation and training of the image classification model.
Thorough evaluation of the model using appropriate metrics.
Effective hyperparameter tuning and model optimization efforts.
Clear error analysis and discussion of model performance.
Quality of the report and presentation, including code documentation and explanations.
Demonstration of an understanding of deep learning for image classification.
